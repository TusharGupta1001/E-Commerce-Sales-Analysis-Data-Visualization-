# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Data-Visualization-
Check out this cool e-commerce data analytics project where I transformed raw transaction data into useful business insights. I got hands-on with Python and some advanced data analytics techniques to dig into customer behavior, spot sales trends, and assess how products were doing. Using awesome tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook, I worked with real e-commerce datasets to pull out valuable insights. Hereâ€™s what I did: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Made sure the data was accurate and reliable by applying thorough cleaning and transformation methods.Sales Analysis: Analyzed monthly sales, broke down revenue by product, and pinpointed both the top and bottom-performing categories.Data Visualization: Created clear visualizations to showcase trends and patterns, helping to guide strategic business decisions.Actionable Insights: Discovered the key factors influencing customer buying habits and overall sales, leading to recommendations for better operational efficiency and customer engagement.This project not only boosted my skills in data manipulation and visualization but also improved my knack for telling a compelling story with data.
